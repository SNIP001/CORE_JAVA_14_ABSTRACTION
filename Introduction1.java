    1.  Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details or internal details and showing only functionality to the user.
    
    2.  Another way, it shows only essential things to the user and hides the internal details, for example, sending 
    SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.
    
    3.  Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.
    
    There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java
    1.  Abstract class (0 to 100%)  [partial abstraction]
    2.  Interface (100%)   [complete abtraction]
